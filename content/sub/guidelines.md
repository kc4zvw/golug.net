## GOLUG Mailing List Rules

These rules are designed to keep our lists fun and helpful:

1. No profanity. There is no reason to use profanity, and it won't be tolerated on any of our lists.

2. No personal insults. Personal insults discourage people from posting, thereby reducing the informational content of our mailing
lists. If you disagree with an idea someone posted, by all means say so, but say so nicely, and make your response about the idea,
not about the person posting it. Personal insults won't be tolerated on any of our lists.

3. No hate, porn, violence, or illegal activities.

4. Try to stay on topic.

5. Be sensitive with SIGs. For instance, a SIG block extoling the virtues of pro-life or pro-choice is offtopic for a technical
list, and very likely to create ill feelings and stimulate flames.
