## Introduction:

GOLUG has not been the only local Orlando Linux user&#39;s group but it does have its own history ...

### About GOLUG

Since its inception in February 2004, Greater Orlando Linux User
Group (GoLUG) has consistently displayed these two qualities:

* Informal (no incorporation, dues, etc)
* General purpose (all aspects of Linux are addressed)

Roughly speaking, about 45% of our members are professional
Admins, 35% are professional Developers, and 20% participate in
GoLUG just because they use Linux. Our meetings, mailing list and
IRC channel accommodate all of these groups. We're a friendly
bunch.

Through its varied members, GoLUG wields a vast body of Linux
information. When Google fails a GoLUGger, the answer, or at
least the direction in which to look, is an email or an IRC post
away.

### GOLUG's Future

The Linux universe looks very different than it did when GoLUG
formed in 2004. The "Linux Revolution" has been won on the
server, and a lot of people use Linux desktops too. For the most
part, these are no longer challenges.

Today's Linux enthusiast adds Linux-loaded devices to the
servers,  desktops and laptops of yesteryear. Phones, tablets,
breadboard computers, and embedded systems are all loadable, to
one degree or another, with Linux.  Without decade-tested,
user-friendly distros for these devices, mastery often involves
experimentation and collaboration. This is part of the new GoLUG.

Another change is that today, for many, Linux is the chosen
development environment. With free versions of every imaginable
language and then some, along with excellent development library
sets and development environments, today's developers shape the
online world using Linux as their base tool. This too is part of
the new GoLUG.

The future of GoLUG is simple: We're going to travel down
whatever road Linux leads us.
